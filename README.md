ITPThesisStreaming
==================

The HTML/JS version of ITP Thesis Streaming
This uses a simple live Flash Video Player: https://github.com/vanevery/Simple-Streaming-Video-Player-Flash to embed 
a number of video streams on a page and allow the user to select which one they would like to view.  
It also has a access through the Flash players to a shared object for data transmission between players from the server.
